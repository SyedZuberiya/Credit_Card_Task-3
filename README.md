# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various classification algorithms. The goal is to predict whether a given transaction is legitimate or fraudulent based on user transaction data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Credit card fraud is a major issue in the financial industry, and early detection is essential to minimize losses. In this project, we build a machine learning model that can predict fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction data.

The model is trained on a dataset with various features such as transaction amount, time, and user details, with the goal of classifying transactions as either `fraudulent` or `non-fraudulent`.

## âœ… Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling imbalanced data, missing values, scaling features, etc.
- **Model Training**: Use of several machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- **Evaluation**: Use of precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate the model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Visualization**: Visualize model performance and feature importance.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Dataset**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description**: The dataset contains credit card transactions, with a `Class` column that indicates whether a transaction is fraud (`1`) or not (`0`).

- **Columns**:
  - `Time`: Time of the transaction.
  - `V1`, `V2`, ..., `V28`: 28 anonymized features representing transaction information.
  - `Amount`: The monetary amount of the transaction.
  - `Class`: 1 if fraud, 0 if legitimate.
